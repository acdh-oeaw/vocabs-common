	<body>
		<p><i>https://vocabs.sshopencloud.eu/vocabularies/</i> is the reserved namespace for hosted vocabularies (refering to skos:conceptScheme/skos:concept) that do not have their own namespace. This does include newly created vocabularies but also vocabularies from places without a dedicated namespace, e.g., they didn't have a SKOS expression and no public URIs like collection of concepts in a spreadsheet.</p>
		<p>The data in this namespace lives in a triple store and can be browsed with the help of <a href="https://skosmos.org">Skosmos</a> at <a href="https://vocabs.sshopencloud.eu/browse/">https://vocabs.sshopencloud.eu/browse/</a>. Concpets from vocabularies of this namespace are resolved against the browse-service to show them in a web-version. There is also the possibility to use the API of Skosmos, please have a look at the information pages of the browse-service.</p>
